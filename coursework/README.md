# Design and Analysis of Algorithms, Part 1

In summer and fall of 2020, I took Professor Tim Roughgarden's course on the [Design and Analysis of Algorithms, Part 1](https://www.edx.org/course/algorithms-design-and-analysis) on edX.

This course, and its subsequent follow-ons, are the online version of CS 161 at Stanford University.

This repo contains my code for the course.
